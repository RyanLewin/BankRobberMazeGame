# BankRobberMazeGame
A game started for a Game Jam at University but I decided to carry on working on it and still am.

These are the scripts used for the game, the Map folder containing all the scripts to proceduraly generate a simple maze.
The Pawn folder contains the scripts for Player controller, including weapon/tool use, and also simple Enemy AI movement, that will walk randomly around the map until they see the player and will follow to kill.
